I attended grad school at the University of Colorado where I earned a master's degree in computer science. I'm a big fan of open science, amateur astronomy, world music and nature photography. A personal mantra is: "We must know â€” we will know"- [David Hilbert](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hilbert)

**Works as ðŸ’»**:  Data Science Software Engineer at a NASA distributed archive center.

**Interests ðŸ”­**: data science, machine learning, data visualization, natural language processing, remote sensing and geospatial processing, simplifying scientific workflows, Raspberry Pi projects, Human Rights.

**Projects I'm currently involved ðŸ’»**:

* [ITS-LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/): Mapping land ice velocity and elevation changes at a global scale.
* [Iceflow](https://nsidc.org/nsidc-highlights/2021/03/there-and-back-again-iceflow-data-tool): Harmonizing lidar data from multiple NASA missions.
* [NASA OpenScapes](https://www.openscapes.org/): Supporting scientific researchers using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud.

**Past projects ðŸ§®**:
* [Apache Nutch](https://github.com/b-cube/nutch-crawler): Crawling the web for scientific datasets
* [HDF metadata extractor/reader](https://github.com/betolink/HDF4MapReader): A very early version of what you see now with cloud oriented data formats like Zarr.
