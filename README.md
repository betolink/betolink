### Hi there 👨‍💻

**About**: My name is Luis Alberto Lopez(he/him) —my family calls me "Beto"—. I'm originally from [Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas), Mexico. I attended grad school at the University of Colorado where I earned a master's degree in computer science. I'm a big fan of amateur astronomy, open science, world music and nature photography.

**Works as**: Software Engineer at a **NASA** distributed archive center (NSIDC).

**Interests**: (data science, machine learning, data visualization, natural language processing, remote sensing, geospatial processing, simplifying scientific workflows, climate change, raspberry pi projects, travel, street food, human rights).

**Currently working on**:

* [ITS-LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/): Mapping land ice velocity and elevation changes at a global scale.
* [Iceflow](https://nsidc.org/nsidc-highlights/2021/03/there-and-back-again-iceflow-data-tool): Harmonizing lidar data from multiple NASA missions.
* [NASA OpenScapes](https://www.openscapes.org/): Supporting scientific researchers using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud.

**Past projects**:
* [Apache Nutch](https://github.com/b-cube/nutch-crawler): Crawling the web for scientific datasets
* [HDF metadata extractor/reader](https://github.com/betolink/HDF4MapReader): A very early version of what you see now with cloud oriented data formats like Zarr.
