### Hi there 👨‍💻

**About**: My name is **Luis Lopez** (he/him) —my family calls me "Beto"—. I'm originally from [Chiapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiapas), Mexico. I'm a fan of amateur astronomy, open science, world music and nature photography.

**I like to geek out about**: (data science, machine learning, data visualization, natural language processing, geospatial processing, simplifying scientific workflows, climate change, raspberry pi projects, travel, street food, human rights).
